So I guess I am going to use this as a place for links to the stuff we do 
and don't do related to class. But also to familiarzie myself with GitHub 
a bit more.

This is a place for mistakes, without regrets. 
For experimenting, without setting your face on fire.
To write silly stuff, and maybe learn something.
